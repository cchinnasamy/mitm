# üë®üèº‚Äçüíª mitm: Man In The Middle

A simple Python project that creates a man-in-the-middle proxy utilizing the standard `Asyncio` library. This project allows you to intercept HTTP and HTTPS traffic via a simple proxy service.

This program does not utilize advance tactics like `sslbump` but rather a very primitive (and often prevented) method for HTTP/HTTPS tampering. To accomplish a man-in-the-middle attack with TLS support `mitm` will generate a self-signed key/certificate that will be utilized to talk back and forth with the client while simultaneously talking with the destination server. If you imagine a typical connection being:
```
client <-> server
```
This program will do the following:
```
client <-> mitm (server) <-> mitm (emulated client) <-> server
```
Where the client speaks with `mitm (server)` and on behalf of the client the `mitm (emulated client)` speaks to to the destination server. The HTTP/HTTPS request and response data is then captured in both pipes and transmitted back and forth while the requests and response are printed to the console.

This project was originally programmed for an advance public proxy management tool and not actually for reasons of exploit. I do caution those that wish to use this for harm, and do not condone the use of this software for such reasons. Use it at your own risk.

## Requirements

* You must have OpenSSL 1.1.1 or greater.
* [PyOpenSSL](https://github.com/pyca/pyopenssl): Generate the SSL certificate and key.

## Installing

Simply clone the project, install, and use.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/synchronizing/mitm
$ cd mitm
$ pip install .
```

## Using

Initializing the proxy is fairly easy.

```python
from mitm import ManInTheMiddle

ManInTheMiddle(host="127.0.0.1", port=8888).run()
```

Once the server is up and running you may either redirect any traffic to the proxy via explicit methods:

```python
import requests
proxies = {"http": "127.0.0.1:8888", "https": "127.0.0.1:8888"}
requests.get("http://api.ipify.org?format=json", proxies=proxies, verify=False).text
requests.get("https://api.ipify.org?format=json", proxies=proxies, verify=False).text
```

Or implicit, via setting the environmental variables `http_proxy` and `https_proxy`, and then using `requests` or `aiohttp` without setting proxies.

```bash
export http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8888
export https_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8888
```

Either way will work.
